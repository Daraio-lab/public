Proposed structure:

Public repos:
	- Instrument Control: routines to control our various instruments

Private repos:
	- Simulation Code: Some various numeric simulation codes people would find useful.
	- FEM Code: Some FEM organizing programs (MATLAB for Comsol, Python for ABAQUS) that people would find useful.
	- Solitonik: For those thar folks.
	- Active folders for ongoing projects between multiple people. Can move folders to public if we want once we've published the info.
